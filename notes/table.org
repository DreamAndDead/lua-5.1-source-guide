* TODO table

- split hash part and array part
  - array, tvalue list
  - hash, node list, like hash bucket
    - node is smart
  - num not in array part, before hash nodes part?
- how to decide array size
  - largest size where n/2 are used (use log method to iterate)
- hash all kind of key (no nil)
  - pointer, str and other
- how metatable works

- metatable now? after vm chapter
- tvaluefields order rocks! value first and tt later. why?
