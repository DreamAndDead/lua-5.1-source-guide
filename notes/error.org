Error handling

Suppose there is an error deep down in a function nested in many other functions and error handling makes sense only in the top level function.

It would be very tedious and awkward if all the functions in between had to return normally and evaluate return values or a global error variable to determine that further processing doesn't make sense or even would be bad.

That's a situation where setjmp/longjmp makes sense. Those situations are similar to situation where exception in other langages (C++, Java) make sense.
